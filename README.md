# I'm Tanushka Srivastava! 👾

I write code that works, designs that shine, and experiments that push limits. By night, I dive into generative art, 3D modeling, and retro gaming worlds—while constantly exploring AI models, graphic design, new tech stacks, and generative AI—because building digital experiences never stops.
